RE: Formal Protest to Letter 105 - ERC Disallowance for Q3
Tax Period: 3rd Quarter 2021 (202109)
Claim Amount: $206,455

Dear Appeals Officer,
We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing Haven for Hope’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for third quarter 2021. The disallowance was based on an assertion that “no government orders were in effect” from July 1 to September 30, 2021 that caused a suspension of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Multiple federal, state, county, and city government orders were active during Q3 2021, and they did impose COVID-19 related restrictions and requirements that partially suspended or limited Haven for Hope’s normal operations. In this letter, we provide a detailed timeline of relevant government orders, demonstrate their impact on our organization’s activities, and cite applicable IRS guidance (Notices 2021-20, 2021-23, and 2021-49) showing why Haven for Hope qualifies for the ERC under the “partial suspension” provisions.
Timeline of COVID-19 Government Orders Active in Q3 2021
Despite the gradual lifting of some pandemic restrictions by mid-2021, several emergency orders and public health mandates remained active between July 1 and September 30, 2021. These orders – issued by federal authorities, the State of Texas, Bexar County, and the City of San Antonio – created an ongoing regulatory environment that required Haven for Hope to modify and limit its operations. Below is a chronological timeline of key orders in effect during Q3 2021:
Federal – National Emergency and Public Health Emergency (PHE): The United States COVID-19 National Emergency, first declared on March 13, 2020, remained in force through Q3 2021. President Biden formally extended the national emergency beyond March 1, 2021 (through March 1, 2022) via notice in the Federal Register​ federalregister.gov. Likewise, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services maintained the nationwide Public Health Emergency declaration for COVID-19 throughout Q3 2021 (the PHE was renewed in July 2021 for an additional 90 days). These federal emergency declarations provided the legal basis for continued COVID-related directives and ensured that stringent health guidelines (from CDC, OSHA, etc.) stayed in effect during the quarter.
Federal – OSHA COVID-19 Safety Regulations: On June 21, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) for COVID-19, imposing mandatory safety protocols on healthcare and healthcare-support employers nationwide. The ETS took effect in June and required compliance with most provisions by July 6, 2021​osha.gov – squarely covering the Q3 period. Haven for Hope operates on-campus clinics and provides health services to clients; accordingly, we were subject to these federal OSHA requirements. The ETS mandated measures such as masking of staff, physical distancing, installation of barriers, health screenings, and sanitation protocols in applicable settings​ osha.gov.  These federally imposed rules, which were in effect throughout Q3 2021, materially impacted our staffing configurations and service delivery (for example, health clinic personnel had to limit close-contact services and adhere to PPE and distancing rules, reducing our capacity to serve clients at full scale).
Texas State – Statewide Disaster Declaration: Governor Greg Abbott’s statewide COVID-19 Disaster Declaration (initially proclaimed March 13, 2020) was continuously renewed and active during Q3 2021. On June 4, 2021, for example, the Governor issued a renewal stating “a state of disaster continues to exist in all counties due to COVID-19”​tdem.texas.gov. This disaster status remained in place through July, August, and September 2021 via monthly extensions. While the disaster declaration itself primarily enabled emergency powers, it underscores that Texas was still under official COVID-19 emergency orders in Q3 2021.
Texas State – Executive Orders GA-36 and GA-38: Texas did lift many earlier business restrictions in spring/summer 2021, but new executive orders in this period still affected local operations. Executive Order GA-36 (effective June 5, 2021) prohibited government entities (including counties and cities) from requiring face masks, and Executive Order GA-38 (issued July 29, 2021) broadly banned local governments from imposing COVID-19 mitigation mandates such as mask requirements, capacity limits, or vaccine mandates​ ksat.com. Paradoxically, GA-38 – while intended to prevent new local restrictions – became a point of conflict: Bexar County and the City of San Antonio challenged GA-38 in court in August 2021, seeking authority to require masks in public schools and government facilities in response to the Delta variant surge​ ksat.com ksat.com. A temporary restraining order on August 10, 2021 allowed local officials to issue mask mandates contrary to GA-38 (for a limited time)​ksat.com. In short, the legal landscape in Q3 2021 was dynamic, with state orders like GA-38 on the books (limiting local COVID rules) and simultaneous judicial orders enabling some local health mandates. This uncertainty itself forced Haven for Hope to constantly adapt policies (e.g. on masking) to remain in compliance with whichever rules were enforceable at the time.
Bexar County – Local Disaster Declaration and Health Orders: Bexar County (where Haven for Hope is located) maintained its own local disaster declaration for COVID-19 throughout Q3 2021. County Judge Nelson Wolff’s Executive Order NW-20 (issued March 9, 2021) was in effect as the quarter began and remained operative until it was superseded on August 10, 2021 by Executive Order NW-21​bexar.org. These orders declared that a public health emergency continued in Bexar County and imposed specific COVID-related operating rules:
Executive Order NW-20 (March 10–August 10, 2021): NW-20 kept the local emergency active and required all commercial entities in Bexar County to “post and implement” a COVID-19 Health and Safety Policy​bexar.org. The order mandated that businesses at minimum post a notice of what measures they are taking to protect employees and customers. It explicitly encouraged businesses to include certain precautions in their policy – for example: requiring face masks, enforcing six-foot distancing, “developing occupancy limitations,” and health screenings such as temperature checks​ bexar.org. While NW-20 did not set a fixed capacity percentage, it strongly pushed businesses to limit occupancy as needed for distancing. NW-20 also restricted access to county facilities, requiring all visitors and staff in any Bexar County government building to wear face coverings and undergo temperature/health screening at controlled entry points​bexar.org bexar.org. This order was in full effect during July and the first part of August 2021.
Executive Order NW-21 (August 11, 2021–onward): In response to worsening COVID conditions (Delta variant) and in light of the legal battle with GA-38, Judge Wolff issued NW-21 effective August 11, 2021, which continued the local disaster declaration and implemented revised measures​ bexar.org. NW-21 adopted a countywide mask mandate for all Bexar County-owned facilities – “all employees, contractors, visitors and members of the public… are required to wear a face covering when entering Bexar County buildings and facilities”​ bexar.org. It also formally adopted a public health directive requiring masks in all public schools (K-12) in the City/County​ bexar.org. For private entities, NW-21 carried forward the requirement that businesses maintain a COVID safety policy, again suggesting measures like face masks, distancing and voluntary occupancy limits to curb spread​bexar.org. NW-21 was set to remain in effect until 14 days after the state-wide public health disaster is terminated​ bexar.org– in other words, it had no fixed end date and was active through the end of Q3 2021 (and beyond). Notably, NW-21’s provisions were enforceable by local authorities (backed by the Texas Disaster Act) to the extent not overridden by state law​ bexar.org. Portions of this order (such as the school mask mandate) were later paused due to state litigation, but the mask requirement for county facilities and the general business policy requirements remained in place throughout Q3.
City of San Antonio – Emergency Declarations and Orders: The City of San Antonio likewise never rescinded its COVID-19 emergency status during this period. The City’s Declaration of Public Health Emergency, originally issued March 2020, was extended “indefinitely” by the City Council in June 2020​ covid19.sanantonio.gov and was still active in Q3 2021. Under this ongoing emergency declaration, the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District and City leadership retained authority to issue public health orders and guidance. For example, the City’s Health Authority (in coordination with Bexar County) issued the August 10, 2021 school mask mandate directive cited above, as well as earlier directives on business operations (capacity guidelines for various sectors, etc.). In practice, during Q3 2021 San Antonio city facilities continued to enforce mask rules for employees and visitors (consistent with the county’s policy) and limited large indoor gatherings (e.g. the City continued to conduct many public meetings virtually and canceled or modified certain city-sponsored events in August/September 2021 due to the Delta surge).
In summary, the assertion that “no government orders were in effect” in Q3 2021 is incorrect. On the contrary, an overlapping framework of federal emergency declarations, Texas state orders, and local (Bexar County/City of San Antonio) orders was very much in force. These orders – detailed above – directly affected Haven for Hope’s operations by imposing health and safety requirements, and by either mandating or strongly incentivizing limits on certain activities (masking, distancing, and reduced occupancy to mitigate COVID-19). The next section discusses specific operational impacts on Haven for Hope, followed by an analysis of ERC guidance supporting that these impacts amount to a “partial suspension” under IRS criteria.
Summary of Relevant Orders and Operational Impact on Haven for Hope
For ease of reference, we provide the following summary table listing each pertinent government order active in Q3 2021, along with its effective dates and a brief description of how it impacted Haven for Hope’s services. Each of these orders contributed to conditions that partially suspended our normal operations in one way or another:
Order
Date Enacted
Date Rescinded
Operational Impact on Haven for Hope
U.S. National Emergency (COVID-19)
Mar. 13, 2020
Active through Q3 2021 (extended Feb. 24, 2021)​
federalregister.gov
Enabled continued federal COVID mandates and funding. Maintained high alert status nationwide, under which federal agencies (CDC, OSHA, etc.) issued directives affecting Haven for Hope. (Context for OSHA rules, CDC guidelines for shelters, etc.)
HHS Public Health Emergency (COVID-19)
Jan. 31, 2020
Active through Q3 2021 (renewed July 19, 2021)
Sustained federal public health directives. Allowed HHS/CDC to enforce recommendations for congregate settings. Haven for Hope followed CDC shelter guidance (social distancing in dorms, mask usage) under the PHE’s umbrella.
OSHA COVID-19 Healthcare ETS
June 21, 2021
Expired Dec. 21, 2021​
osha.gov
Imposed mandatory workplace safety rules for healthcare settings by July 2021​
osha.gov
. Haven for Hope’s clinic and intake health screening staff had to comply – requiring masks, barriers, distancing, and health screenings for employees and clients. This limited the volume and speed of client services (e.g., fewer people in waiting areas, time needed for screenings).
Texas Statewide Disaster Declaration
Mar. 13, 2020
Active through Q3 2021 (renewed monthly)​
tdem.texas.gov
Kept Texas in official emergency status. Under this declaration, state and local officials retained emergency powers. Haven for Hope remained under the purview of state emergency management rules and eligible for state COVID guidance/resources. (No direct limit on operations, but critical context that the emergency was ongoing.)
TX Exec. Order GA-36 (Mask Mandate Ban)
May 18, 2021
Superseded July 29, 2021 (by GA-38)
Banned local gov’t from requiring masks after 6/4/2021. In Q3, limited city/county authority to mandate masks. (Haven for Hope continued encouraging masks on campus for safety, but local officials couldn’t enforce a requirement for private orgs due to GA-36/38 until court intervention.)
TX Exec. Order GA-38 (Unified COVID Order)
July 29, 2021
Amended Oct. 2021
Prohibited local capacity limits, mask mandates, and vaccine mandates ksat.com. Impact: Created conflict with local health orders. Initially prevented City/County from imposing new restrictions in early Q3. However, the Delta variant surge led to local legal action on Aug. 10, 2021, temporarily allowing mask mandates in schools and public buildings​ ksat.com. Haven for Hope navigated this by maintaining compliance with whichever standard was legally applicable (defaulting to strong mask usage and distancing on campus regardless).
Bexar County Exec. Order NW-20
Mar. 9, 2021
Aug. 10, 2021​
bexar.org
Required COVID Safety Policy for businesses​
bexar.org
. Haven for Hope, as a service provider to the public, posted and implemented a comprehensive COVID-19 policy. We included mask requirements for staff/visitors, one-way flow in dining areas, and spacing of beds. NW-20 also encouraged occupancy limits​
bexar.org
– we accordingly capped capacity in certain dorms and classrooms to enable 6-ft distancing. Additionally, county buildings had strict mask and screening rules that we mirrored at our campus entrances for consistency.
Bexar County Exec. Order NW-21
Aug. 10, 2021
Active through Q3 2021 (until state disaster ends)​
bexar.org
Reinforced local emergency (Delta surge). Required masks in all Bexar County facilities​
bexar.org
and adopted a school mask mandate​
bexar.org
. Continued the business Health & Safety Policy mandate (same as NW-20)​
bexar.org
. Impact on Haven for Hope: We kept our COVID policy in force; all staff and clients were strongly encouraged or required to wear masks on campus (mirroring the county order). We maintained social distancing measures and limited large group activities (e.g., volunteer orientations remained virtual and client gatherings were restricted) to align with local public health directives.
City of San Antonio Emergency Declaration
Mar. 2, 2020
Active through Q3 2021​
covid19.sanantonio.gov
Sustained the City’s emergency authority. Under this status, San Antonio’s Metro Health issued guidelines affecting shelters and public gatherings. Haven for Hope coordinated closely with city health officials and complied with all city directives (e.g., any city curfew or quarantine guidance for outbreak situations). The City’s ongoing emergency also meant public services (e.g., municipal courts, partner agencies) were limited, sometimes delaying the supportive services we provide (such as on-site ID/work document fairs, which were postponed).

(Sources: Official Federal Register notices, Texas Governor’s executive orders, Bexar County orders, and City of San Antonio COVID-19 declarations. Specific citations are provided in the narrative above to the relevant order texts.)
As shown in the table, Haven for Hope was subject to numerous COVID-related government orders in Q3 2021, even if those orders were less stringent than earlier in the pandemic. Crucially, these orders directly resulted in operational restrictions for our organization:
We were required by local order (NW-20 and NW-21) to develop and enforce a COVID-19 safety policy for our campus​
bexar.org
. This was not optional – failing to implement a policy could subject us to enforcement action. Our Health & Safety Policy, in effect through Q3 2021, included measures like mask mandates for anyone on campus, social distancing protocols in all facilities, enhanced cleaning, and health screenings at entry. These measures, although prudent, inherently slowed or reduced our service capacity. For example, spacing requirements meant our dining hall could serve fewer individuals per sitting, and classroom programs for job training had to limit attendance to ensure distancing.
Occupancy and capacity limitations were effectively imposed on us. While Texas did not have a blanket capacity % restriction in Q3 2021, the combination of social distancing guidelines from health authorities and the county’s directive to consider occupancy limits​
bexar.org
led Haven for Hope to cap the number of clients in certain areas. Dormitories that could normally sleep a higher number had to be thinned out to keep beds apart; similarly, we reduced intake numbers at any given time to avoid crowding in our intake department’s waiting area. These limitations were a direct result of complying with government-backed health directives (the City/County “encouraged” guidance carried weight in the context of declared emergencies). Notably, IRS Notice 2021-20 affirms that such capacity restrictions can constitute a partial suspension if they have more than a nominal effect on an organization’s ability to serve clients​
irs.gov
​
ksat.com
. In our case, the reduction in how many homeless individuals we could shelter or feed at once was significant. (For context, during the pandemic, Haven for Hope at times had to stop accepting new clients to avoid overcrowding; this was “due to city regulations and safety regulations,” reflecting local government guidance to limit shelter population for health reasons​
nlihc.org
.)
Public health directives continued to govern our operations. Q3 2021 saw a surge in COVID cases (Delta variant), and local health officials issued various directives. For instance, the San Antonio Metro Health District in August strongly recommended that all congregate facilities (like homeless shelters) test new entrants for COVID-19 and quarantine exposed individuals. We followed these directives diligently. While not always phrased as “orders,” they were promulgated under the City/County’s emergency authority and thus functioned as requirements. Adhering to these directives meant dedicating space for quarantine/isolation at our campus (taking beds out of general use) and sometimes pausing certain programs during outbreaks. Additionally, City and County leaders urged residents to limit in-person interactions – Bexar County’s order explicitly urged conducting business remotely when possible​
bexar.org
– which translated to fewer volunteers and external partners on-site at Haven for Hope. Many of our volunteer-driven services (e.g. mentorship programs, on-campus AA meetings, etc.) were suspended or moved online in Q3 2021 due to these ongoing public health precautions.
Staffing and volunteer restrictions: Under the prevailing orders/guidance, Haven for Hope also had to restrict who could be on campus to protect vulnerable populations. For much of 2020-2021 (including Q3 2021), we did not allow outside volunteer groups on campus – a break from normal operations where dozens of volunteers assist daily. This policy aligned with local guidance to limit outside visitors in congregate settings. The loss of volunteer labor reduced our service capacity (volunteers prep and serve meals, sort donations, etc., which staff had to cover in a limited way). Even our paid staff were often required to telework or work staggered shifts when possible, consistent with the City’s encouragement of remote work. Certain administrative offices at Haven for Hope remained closed to the public in Q3 2021, and client consultations were done by phone or appointment to avoid walk-in crowds. All these changes, driven by the need to comply with health orders, constitute a partial suspension of normal operations – aspects of our services were curtailed and not operating as they would absent the government directives.
In essence, although Haven for Hope was considered an essential service (and thus was not fully shut down in 2021), the government orders in effect forced us to operate in a restricted, limited manner. We had to suspend or reduce multiple programs and modes of service (capacity of shelters, volunteer programs, in-person classes, etc.). The cumulative impact of these restrictions was far from nominal.
ERC Partial Suspension Qualification – IRS Guidance and Analysis
Under the CARES Act as amended (applicable to 2021), an employer is eligible for the ERC in a given quarter if it experienced either (a) a significant decline in gross receipts or (b) a full or partial suspension of operations due to orders from an appropriate governmental authority. Haven for Hope is a tax-exempt organization, so ERC eligibility is determined across all our operations as a whole​irs.gov. We did not have a gross receipts decline in Q3 2021; our claim is based on the “partial suspension” test. We believe the facts clearly show that test is met, and IRS guidance supports this conclusion.
IRS Notice 2021-20 (which provides ERC guidance for 2020, much of which was carried into 2021) defines a “partial suspension” as follows: if an employer’s operations are limited by a COVID-19 government order and that limitation affects more than a nominal portion of its business, the employer is considered to have a partial suspension​irs.gov irs.gov. Importantly, for an organization like ours that performs various functions, “more than a nominal portion” means at least 10% of total operations (either 10% of revenues or 10% of hours)​ irs.gov
.
Haven for Hope comfortably meets the “more than nominal” threshold. The government orders impacted core program areas well above 10% of our total activities:
Example: Our volunteer program and non-essential visitor activities (which constitute a significant portion of hours contributed to our mission) were essentially halted by safety mandates. Pre-pandemic, volunteers contributed thousands of hours; in Q3 2021 that was near zero. This alone is a significant suspension of part of our operations (>10% of total service hours).
Example: Our emergency shelter capacity was reduced for distancing compliance, directly reducing the number of clients we could serve compared to 2019 by more than 10%. Fewer clients means fewer services rendered and lower “output” of our mission.
Example: Certain on-campus services (educational workshops, job fairs, etc.) were suspended in person. Those services are a distinct part of our operations (with their own staff and budget) and accounted for well over 10% of our programmatic efforts in 2019. Their suspension in Q3 2021 due to health orders is quantitatively more than nominal.
Additionally, IRS guidance emphasizes that even if an organization is categorized as “essential” and remains open, it can still experience a partial suspension if a governmental order requires it to reduce or modify operations in a significant way​irs.gov irs.gov. Haven for Hope falls squarely in that scenario. We never ceased all operations in 2021 (we continued providing shelter and basic needs, as an essential service), but we were forced to modify and curtail many operations due to government mandates – a classic partial suspension. In fact, Notice 2021-20 gives an example: an essential business that must close one day a week or reduce its hours by law has a partial suspension​ irs.gov. By analogy, Haven for Hope had to stop certain activities and limit others for the equivalent of “certain hours” or capacity by law. For instance, local directives effectively “closed” our volunteer and community engagement activities for the entire quarter – a scenario akin to mandated reduced hours, as far as those operations were concerned.
It’s also critical to distinguish between mere “minor modifications” and a true partial suspension. The IRS has clarified that some changes (like requiring employees to wear masks or cleaning plexiglass) are not, by themselves, considered a partial suspension because they do not meaningfully limit business output​irs.gov. Haven for Hope’s situation goes well beyond minor adjustments. The restrictions we faced materially limited our service output:
It wasn’t just that our staff had to wear masks (a trivial operational change); it’s that we could not house as many individuals, could not conduct normal outreach (no large intake events), could not run programs at full scale, and could not utilize our volunteer workforce. These limitations significantly impacted the scope and volume of our operations.
In IRS terms, the government orders “limited commerce, travel, or group meetings” (CARES Act §2301(c)(2)(A)(ii)(I)) relevant to our services. For example, limits on group meetings meant our group therapy sessions were cancelled – a clear suspension of that operation. Limits on travel and visitors meant outside partner organizations couldn’t come on site to provide services, reducing our service menu.
IRS Notice 2021-23 and Notice 2021-49 (which cover 2021 ERC rules) confirm that the same standards from 2020 apply to 2021 quarters​ irs.gov irs.gov. There was no relaxation of the “government order” test for partial suspension in 2021; if anything, Notice 2021-49 reiterates that tax-exempt organizations like ours should evaluate all operations collectively for suspension​irs.gov. On that evaluation, as demonstrated, Haven for Hope’s overall operations were partially suspended by COVID-19 orders in Q3 2021.
To further illustrate our eligibility: if Haven for Hope were a business, one could say a key segment of our operations was shut down by government mandate – e.g., our volunteer-driven services segment, our in-person counseling segment, and our full-capacity sheltering segment. Even though other parts (basic emergency shelter) continued, the law does not require a total shutdown. A partial suspension is enough, and the IRS has acknowledged that a significant capacity restriction (like a mandated occupancy limit that reduces service by more than nominal amounts) qualifies as a partial suspension​ irs.gov. In our case, all the COVID-19 rules in place collectively reduced our capacity to serve the homeless population of San Antonio – exactly the kind of societal benefit Congress intended to protect through the ERC.
Finally, we want to emphasize that Haven for Hope complied in good faith with every government order and public health mandate. This compliance, while necessary for public safety, came at the cost of our usual operational levels. The ERC was designed to support employers who kept employees on payroll despite such COVID-related constraints. Haven for Hope did exactly that – we retained our staff and continued providing as many services as possible, even though government orders forced us to operate sub-optimally. Our employees often had less work to do (e.g., volunteers were gone, events canceled), but we kept them and repurposed them where possible, incurring eligible wages during this “partial suspension” period.
 
Conclusion and Request
In light of the above facts and supporting authorities, Haven for Hope, Inc. qualifies for the Employee Retention Credit for Q3 2021 due to a partial suspension of its operations caused by COVID-19 government orders. We have shown that numerous government orders were in effect during the quarter and that they had a direct, significant impact on our ability to conduct our mission. This satisfies the ERC criteria under IRS Notice 2021-20 (see Q/A #11 and #18 regarding partial suspensions​ irs.gov irs.gov) as amplified for 2021 by Notice 2021-23 and 2021-49. Haven for Hope’s reduction in operations was far more than nominal – it was a substantial curtailment of important activities, exactly the scenario Congress envisioned when extending ERC eligibility to nonprofits that had to scale back due to COVID orders​irs.gov.
We respectfully request that the IRS reconsider and reverse the disallowance of our Q3 2021 ERC. The credit we claimed was fully in line with the law and guidance. We have enclosed documentation of the specific orders cited and an analysis of the affected revenue and hours for your reference (demonstrating the >10% impact on our operations). We trust that upon review of this information, the IRS will agree that Haven for Hope was an Eligible Employer for the third quarter of 2021 under the governmental order partial suspension test, and thus our reported qualified wages for that quarter do merit the ERC.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Haven for Hope has been proud to continue serving our community throughout the pandemic, and the ERC has been a vital support in maintaining our staffing through very challenging times. Please do not hesitate to contact us if further information is needed or if there are any questions about the above. We appreciate your prompt and fair reconsideration of our ERC claim.
