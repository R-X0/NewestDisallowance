COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)  

─────────────────────────────  
Federal Orders

1. Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later formally terminated by Congress in 2023, outside our period)  
   • Rescinded By: Later congressional action (beyond 2020–2021)  
   • Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding mechanisms that in turn empowered state and local authorities to impose stricter public health orders. Although it did not mandate business closures by itself, it created the legal and political framework that allowed subsequent state and local lockdown orders. In Q3 2020, while the proclamation continued to be in force, local and state orders – which were backed by this national emergency – continued to restrict business operations, influence economic aid and signal the severity of the pandemic.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
   • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (remained in effect through 2021; lifted later in April 2022 by court order)  
   • Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022  
   • Summary: In early 2021, the new federal administration instituted mask-wearing requirements for passengers and travelers on airplanes, trains, and buses as well as in federal facilities. Although these mandates did not directly affect the day‑to‑day operations of most private Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020 (since the orders began in 2021), they illustrate the continuation of a layered federal response to the pandemic. They also underscore the overall “stay safe” approach that was beginning to shift from comprehensive shutdowns toward specific safety protocols as the pandemic evolved.

─────────────────────────────  
California State Orders

1. State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency  
   • Order Number: Not applicable (Governor’s Proclamation)  
   • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency continued throughout the period)  
   • Rescinded By: Later ended in February 2023 by gubernatorial proclamation (beyond our timeframe)  
   • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency to mobilize resources and streamline regulatory responses in reaction to rapidly increasing COVID‑19 cases. This declaration provided the legal authority for subsequent orders that restricted business operations, allowed faster reallocation of resources, and enabled emergency funding. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, the state of emergency was the backdrop against which all further lockdown and reopening measures were implemented. Maintaining such an emergency status justified continued restrictions on non‑essential business operations throughout the year.

2. Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order  
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) which terminated the statewide stay‑at‑home order  
   • Summary: This order mandated that all California residents remain at home except for essential activities. It forced the closure of “non‑essential” businesses such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc., while only allowing essential businesses (grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) to operate. By Q3 2020, although some phased reopenings had been attempted, many sectors in Camarillo were still very much restricted or operating at limited capacity because the underlying stay‑at‑home framework had not been fully lifted. This order—especially through its successive modifications—helped explain the ongoing challenges faced by local businesses during the third quarter of 2020.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)  
   • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued per EO N‑60‑20)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)  
   • Summary: As early COVID‑19 case numbers plateaued in the spring, the state began a cautious reopening. The May 7 order allowed lower‑risk businesses (such as curbside retail and supply chain operations for those sectors) to resume operations, though higher‑risk venues like dine‑in restaurants and gyms stayed closed. For Camarillo businesses, this order meant that by summer some operations could restart under strict safety protocols—but the later summer surge led to additional rollbacks that again limited operations during Q3 2020. The phased and conditional reopening highlighted the economic and operational uncertainty local businesses faced during this period.

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: The August 28, 2020 State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order, and later the Beyond Blueprint order on June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: In response to a sharp rise in COVID‑19 cases in July 2020, the state re‑imposed closures on many indoor operations that had been allowed under Stage 2 reopening. This order forced closures in sectors such as indoor dining, bars, gyms, and more. For many Camarillo businesses that were beginning to reopen in May and June, this rollback meant that operations were again severely restricted during Q3 2020, impacting revenues and adding to uncertainty. The order underscored the volatility of the reopening process as states attempted to balance economic recovery with public health concerns.

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System  
   • Order Number: (State Public Health Officer Order issued August 28, 2020)  
   • Date Enacted: Announced August 28, 2020 (effective August 31, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (terminated by the Beyond Blueprint Order)  
   • Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: This framework introduced a color‑coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) to dictate which business sectors could operate and under what restrictions, based on local case and testing metrics. Ventura County – which includes Camarillo – was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that many indoor operations remained closed or had very limited capacity during Q3 2020. Although the tier system replaced earlier “one‑size‑fits‑all” closures, the fact that Ventura County remained near the bottom of the scale throughout most of Q3 2020 continued to place a heavy burden on local businesses. The framework provided a predictable (if still restrictive) system for reopening that local businesses had to navigate.

6. Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
   • Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced, triggered in the Southern California region on December 6, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: A state announcement lifting the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order on January 25, 2021 as ICU availability improved  
   • Summary: In December 2020, as hospitals in Southern California began to experience ICU capacity critically below 15%, the state issued a Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order. This stricter order required the closure of many business sectors, including the cessation of both indoor and outdoor operations for restaurants (allowing only take‑out), complete closures for personal care services, movie theaters, museums, and more. Although its direct effect was in Q4 2020, its looming threat contributed to the cautious business environment in Q3 2020 as stakeholders anticipated possible renewed lockdowns if ICU levels fell further. It served as a “safety valve” to force compliance should the pandemic surge again.

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay‑at‑Home/Tiers  
   • Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21/State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  
   • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order ended all previous COVID‑related business restrictions)  
   • Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded the previous orders  
   • Summary: Marking the full reopening of California, the “Beyond the Blueprint” order officially terminated the state‑wide stay‑at‑home order and the tier framework. It removed capacity limits, distancing requirements, and most other restrictions on business operations. The order, effective June 15, 2021, stands in sharp contrast to the Q3 2020 situation when businesses in Camarillo continued to operate under severe restrictions. Its issuance highlighted just how long-lasting the impact on local businesses had been during 2020 and early 2021.

Ventura County Orders

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
   • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (continued until officially ended in March 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution (post-2021)  
   • Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency in response to COVID‑19. While the declaration itself did not impose restrictions, it set the legal ground for subsequent local health orders and enabled the county to enforce state directives at a local level. For businesses in Q3 2020, the active local emergency meant that any newly issued county measures – such as local enforcement of mask mandates or safety protocols – were backed by this declaration, thereby reinforcing the economic and operational constraints.  
   • Source:  
     (Typically available on Ventura County’s official website or press releases.)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
   • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order (and later formally repealed)  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County’s March 20, 2020 order  
   • Summary: This early order in Ventura County mandated closures of venues such as bars, gyms, and theaters and imposed restrictions on gatherings before the state issued its orderly stay‑at‑home mandate. Although it was short‑lived as a stand‑alone directive, its spirit influenced all later local orders. Its aggressive early action set a precedent that led to further county measures which continued to affect how local businesses could operate well into Q3 2020.  
   • Source:  
     (Refer to Ventura County public health order documents archived online.)

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay‑Home Order  
   • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in alignment with state reopening; formally by the Ventura County Health Officer’s update)  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities, effectively closing all non‑essential businesses including many in Camarillo. Even though the order was modified over time to permit limited reopening, its original framework dictated that most businesses operate at a minimal level or not at all in Q3 2020. It continued to influence local operating guidelines (such as capacity restrictions and outdoor-only operations) throughout the summer and early fall.

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
   • Order Dates:  
     – March 31, 2020: Extended stay-at-home to April 19, 2020  
     – April 9, 2020: Added gathering bans and safety protocols  
     – April 20, 2020: Further extended the stay-at-home order through May 15, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (by May 7, 2020)  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap  
   • Summary: Throughout March and April 2020, Ventura County repeatedly updated its orders to extend and tighten restrictions as the pandemic evolved. These updates introduced social distancing measures for essential businesses and closed down venues that might otherwise allow gatherings. Although these orders were replaced by the reopening framework later, they established the rigorous safety protocols that continued to be enforced (in modified form) during Q3 2020 and influenced business operations even as restrictions evolved.  
   • Source:  
     (Links to relevant county documents exist on official Ventura County websites.)

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
   • Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (amended)  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint order on August 31, 2020 and later by the June 15, 2021 order  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020 and ultimately the June 15, 2021 reopening order  
   • Summary: As the county began transitioning away from a full lockdown, Ventura County’s “Safely Reopening” order permitted select lower‑risk businesses to reopen (such as curbside retail and certain manufacturing) and later, with amendments, allowed dine‑in restaurants and in‑store retail to resume with strict guidelines. For Q3 2020, this order meant that although some Camarillo businesses were open, they continued to operate under significant restrictions (and, for some sectors, soon faced additional rollbacks when cases surged again in July 2020). It was the first step toward reopening but also illustrated the fragility of the recovery plan.  
   • Source:  
     (For example, see related documents on Ventura County’s “Stay Well VC – Safely Reopening” orders available online.)

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)  
   • Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
   • Date Rescinded: Automatically expired on July 6, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: Order expired as written  
   • Summary: In anticipation of heavy crowds during the Independence Day weekend and amid rising cases, Ventura County ordered that beaches and adjacent parking areas be closed. Although Camarillo itself is inland, many local businesses that benefit from tourist and leisure traffic in the region were indirectly affected. This short‑term measure reflected the willingness of local authorities to take swift action to prevent “super‑spreader” events, a factor that also contributed to the overall uncertain business conditions in Q3 2020.

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved into Tier 2  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
   • Summary: Following the state’s July 13 statewide rollback, Ventura County issued an order to enforce these closures locally. Indoor operations for gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, and personal care services in the county (and hence in Camarillo) were mandated to close or operate only in an outdoor format. This order meant that many local businesses that had briefly reopened in early summer were forced to close again in July, contributing to the severe operational challenges in Q3 2020.  
   • Source:  
     (See Ventura County Health Officer orders; many local news reports, e.g., on vcportal.ventura.org, document these measures.)

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
   • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Began to change as states later shifted policies (and in January 2021 further restrictions reappeared; finally statewide reopening came on June 15, 2021)  
   • Rescinded By: Later orders (for example, the December Regional Order and ultimately the June 15, 2021 order)  
   • Summary: Due to improving public health metrics, Ventura County moved into the Red tier on October 6, 2020. This order allowed specified businesses (gyms, houses of worship, personal care establishments) to reopen indoors subject to capacity and safety rules. Although this order marked the beginning of easing restrictions, most of Q3 2020 had been very challenging, and the easing came only toward the very end of the quarter, signaling a tentative return toward normality. However, the return was short-lived as subsequent surges necessitated more restrictions.  
   • Source:  
     (Official county documents such as those available from vcportal.ventura.org.)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
   • Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and its subsequent extensions)  
   • Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial passage on March 31, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: The commercial moratorium was extended through September 30, 2020; residential protections later were superseded by the California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) effective September 1, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: For residential tenants, replaced by state law via AB 3088; for commercial tenants, the county’s extension expired  
   • Summary: To help both residents and small businesses cope with lost income during the pandemic, the county imposed an eviction moratorium that prevented landlords in Ventura County from evicting commercial and residential tenants who were financially impacted by COVID‑19. For Q3 2020, this meant that businesses facing revenue shortfalls – such as a small retailer or restaurant in Camarillo – were temporarily protected from eviction. Although this measure did not forgive rent, it provided critical relief by deferring payments at a time when many businesses were unable to operate at full capacity.

City of Camarillo Orders

1. Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
   • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (continued until officially lifted in 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A later City Council resolution (post‑2021)  
   • Summary: The City of Camarillo declared a local emergency on March 13, 2020 to activate the Emergency Operations Center and coordinate a rapid response to COVID‑19. This declaration led to immediate actions such as the closure of city facilities and the cancellation of public events. Although not directly imposing business closures, the emergency status provided the authority for all subsequent local orders that affected business operations (for instance, adjustments to how permits were processed). In Q3 2020, this standing emergency ensured that additional local measures (both restrictive and supportive) could be enforced if needed.  
   • Source:  
     (Information available on Camarillo’s official government website and press releases.)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
   • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (issued March 18, 2020) with an amendment on April 23, 2020  
   • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, eventually superseded by state law (AB 3088) in August/September 2020; any remaining commercial protections ended when the local emergency was terminated  
   • Rescinded By: State law for residential cases and later local action for commercial cases  
   • Summary: Camarillo quickly followed county measures by enacting its own eviction moratorium to further protect local businesses and residents from being forced out due to economic hardships. By preventing eviction for non‑payment of rent stemming from COVID‑19–related losses, the city provided additional time for businesses in Camarillo to adjust their operations and finances during the acute phase of the pandemic in Q3 2020. This measure was especially important for small retail and restaurant businesses that relied on timely rental payments to remain operational.  
   • Source:  
     (Official city press releases and Camarillo documents; see links such as those provided on CamHealth or city council pages.)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
   • Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Expired when COVID‑19 capacity restrictions ended (effectively June 15, 2021)  
   • Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated  
   • Summary: To help restaurants cope with the inability to operate indoors at full capacity under state restrictions, the City of Camarillo adopted Resolution No. 2020‑63. This resolution waived certain zoning and fee requirements to allow temporary outdoor dining setups in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. For Q3 2020, when many restaurants faced indoor closures or severe capacity limits, this measure enabled them to serve customers outside and mitigate losses. It provided a vital economic lifeline by allowing a degree of operation even when indoor dining was not permitted.

4. Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
   • Dates: Various during spring to summer 2020  
   • Summary: In addition to the major orders listed above, Camarillo took several other steps to lessen the economic impact on local businesses. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online to reduce in‑person contact, and promoting take‑out dining initiatives to support local restaurants. While these were not “orders” in the strict sense, they formed an important part of the overall local response that influenced how businesses operated under COVID‑19 conditions – especially in Q3 2020 when many were trying to adapt to rapidly changing restrictions.

Summary Analysis for Q3 2020 Business Impact

Across all levels of government—from federal emergency proclamations to state‑wide stay‑at‑home orders and local measures in Ventura County and the City of Camarillo—the result was a patchwork of directives that dramatically affected business operations in Q3 2020. Many establishments in Camarillo had been forced to close or operate at severely reduced capacity during the initial lockdown. Even when phased reopenings were attempted (via the “Safely Reopening” orders or the Blueprint tier system), subsequent surges (and the July 13 rollbacks) meant that businesses had little time to stabilize operations before facing renewed restrictions. Additionally, relief measures like eviction moratoria and outdoor dining waivers provided some critical support but came with their own limitations. Overall, the persistent uncertainty, frequent changes, and layered nature of these orders – along with the looming threat of further shutdowns (as seen in December 2020) – cumulatively contributed to the extraordinarily challenging environment faced by Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020.
