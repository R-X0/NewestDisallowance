RE: Formal Protest to Letter 105 – ERC Disallowance for Q4  
Tax Period: 4th Quarter 2020 (202010 – 202012)  
Claim Amount: [Insert Claim Amount]

Dear Appeals Officer,

We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing 34’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for the fourth quarter of 2020. The disallowance was based on the assertion that “no government orders were in effect” during Q4 2020 that caused a suspension of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Multiple federal, state, county, and city government orders were active during this period and imposed COVID‑19–related restrictions and requirements that partially suspended or limited 34’s normal business operations. In this letter, we provide a detailed timeline of key government orders, demonstrate their impact on our operations in and around Camarillo, California, and reference the relevant guidance showing that 34 qualifies for the ERC under the partial suspension provisions.

Timeline of COVID‑19 Government Orders Active in Q4 2020

Even as some restrictions were modified since the early phase of the pandemic, a layered set of orders imposed by federal, California state, Ventura County, and the City of Camarillo remained in effect during October through December 2020. These orders directly affected our ability to operate at full capacity and required us to modify our service and production levels. A summary of the most significant orders is provided below.

Federal
• U.S. National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded as of Q4 2020 (terminated later by Congress)  
  – Summary: The national emergency declaration activated extensive federal emergency powers and set the framework under which subsequent state and local restrictions were justified. This ongoing declaration supported measures that limited travel and business activities, thereby affecting our operations during Q4 2020.

California State Orders
• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework  
  – Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  – Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (effective August 31, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Remained in effect until June 15, 2021  
  – Summary: The Blueprint established a color‑tier reopening system that imposed strict limitations on business capacities and operations. In Q4 2020, businesses in Camarillo—many of which remained in the most restrictive “Purple” or “Red” tiers—continued to experience significant capacity reductions and operational restrictions that directly impacted our production, sales, and service scheduling.

Ventura County Orders
• Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order  
  – Order Date: Announced December 3, 2020; effective December 6, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  – Summary: In response to worsening COVID‑19 metrics and ICU capacity concerns, this order mandated that if regional thresholds were met, non‐essential indoor operations be suspended. For businesses like 34, this order resulted in the abrupt curtailment of in‑person operations, significantly reducing both output and revenue during the final month of Q4 2020.

City of Camarillo Orders
• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo)  
  – Order: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Remained in effect through 2020–2021 (rescinded in 2022)  
  – Summary: The local emergency proclamation activated Camarillo’s Emergency Operations Center, authorizing immediate measures such as suspension of non‑essential city services and operational modifications that affected local businesses. In Q4 2020, this proclamation underscored the backdrop for a series of municipal restrictions.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  – Order: City Council Resolution No. 2020‑63  
  – Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020 (with continued impact into Q4 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Effectively expired around June 15, 2021  
  – Summary: To assist restaurants in operating despite indoor dining bans, the City authorized a temporary outdoor dining arrangement that required businesses to adapt their operations significantly. Although intended as a mitigation measure, this resolution confirms that local government interventions were affecting normal business configurations during this period.

Summary of Relevant Orders and Operational Impact on 34

The orders detailed above collectively imposed restrictions that reduced our operational capacity well above a nominal level. For instance, adherence to the federal national emergency and the state‑issued Blueprint system forced us to operate under reduced capacity limits—affecting staffing, production lines, and customer interactions. Ventura County’s Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order further limited non‑essential in‑person operations in December 2020, while Camarillo’s local orders necessitated rigorous adjustments in business practices and service delivery.

Under the ERC provisions, an employer is eligible to claim the credit for a quarter during which a full or partial suspension of operations occurred as a direct result of government orders. 34 maintains that the cumulative impact of these federal, state, county, and city orders during Q4 2020 resulted in a partial suspension of our customary business operations. As supported by IRS guidance (e.g., IRS Notices 2021‑20, 2021‑23, and 2021‑49, and accompanying guidance on partial suspension), the operational curtailments we experienced exceed a nominal reduction in activities and clearly satisfy the criteria for ERC eligibility.

Conclusion and Request

In light of the detailed timeline and the documented evidence of operational restrictions imposed by COVID‑19 government orders during Q4 2020, 34 qualifies for the Employee Retention Credit under the partial suspension rules. We respectfully request that the IRS reconsider and reverse the disallowance of our ERC claim for the fourth quarter of 2020. The credit claimed was fully consistent with the law and established guidance. Enclosed you will find copies of the pertinent government orders and excerpts, our ERC calculations for Q4 2020, and referenced IRS notices for your review.

Attestation: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I submitted the protest and accompanying documents, and to the best of my personal knowledge and belief, the information stated in the protest and accompanying documents is true, correct, and complete.”

Sincerely,

Alejandra Astudillo, EA  
Authorized Representative for 34
