**ChatGPT:** To gather the most relevant COVID-related government orders affecting a business in Camarillo, California, during 2020-2021, I need some clarification:

1. **Type of Business**: Are you referring to a general business, or do you have a specific industry in mind (e.g., retail, restaurant, manufacturing, service-based)? Certain regulations varied by industry.
2. **Scope**: Should I include federal, state (California), county (Ventura County), and city-level (Camarillo) orders, or do you want only state and local regulations?
3. **Level of Detail**: Do you need the full text of the orders, or just a summary with key points (such as restrictions on capacity, operational changes, or closures)?

Let me know so I can refine the research accordingly!
