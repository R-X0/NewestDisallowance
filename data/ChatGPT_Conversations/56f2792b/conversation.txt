# COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

This document outlines key federal, state, county, and city orders that shaped the regulatory environment for businesses in Camarillo, California, during the peak pandemic years. Each entry includes order identifiers, dates of enactment and, where applicable, rescission, along with a detailed summary of provisions and its impact on business operations—especially as felt in Q3 2020.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## Federal Orders

• **Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19**  
  – **Date Enacted:** March 13, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (the emergency declaration remained active in that period)  
  – **Rescinded By:** Later terminated by Congress (beyond our timeframe)  
  **Summary:** This proclamation declared a national emergency over the COVID-19 outbreak. Although it did not mandate business closures per se, it activated federal emergency powers and funding streams. Its continuation provided the legal backdrop that empowered state and local authorities to impose more direct public health restrictions. In Q3 2020, while businesses were not directly shut down by the federal decree, the persistent emergency status indirectly influenced all subsequent regulatory measures.

• **CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel**  
  – **Date Enacted:** January 21, 2021 (with subsequent orders by the CDC effective February 1, 2021)  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Remained in effect through 2021 (later lifted in 2022)  
  **Summary:** Although primarily targeting travel settings—airplanes, trains, buses, and federal facilities—these mandates reflected the continuing federal efforts to control transmission. They did not directly affect local business operations in Camarillo in Q3 2020, but they signaled a broader shift in federal policy toward safety protocols rather than blanket closures.

## California State Orders

• **State of Emergency Proclamation**  
  – **Order:** Governor Newsom’s Emergency Proclamation (no specific order number)  
  – **Date Enacted:** March 4, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Remained in effect through 2020–2021 (ended later in 2023)  
  **Summary:** Governor Newsom declared a state of emergency which provided the legal authority to suspend regular laws and mobilize resources. This empowered rapid issuance of public health orders affecting business operations. In Q3 2020, the blanket state emergency meant that even as specific orders evolved, the underlying legal framework for imposing restrictions remained intact—justifying continued limitations on non-essential businesses.

• **Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide 'Stay-at-Home' Order**  
  – **Date Enacted:** March 19, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021 (rescinded by Executive Order N-07-21)  
  **Summary:** This early and sweeping order required all Californians to remain in their residences except for essential activities. It forced non-essential businesses (such as restaurants offering dine–in services, retail sectors, gyms, etc.) to close or modify operations drastically. Although many restrictions were gradually lifted over time, the lingering effects in Q3 2020 were evident in the form of limited operating capacities and ongoing uncertainty for businesses in Camarillo.

• **State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening – May 7, 2020)**  
  – **Date Enacted:** May 7, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by later phases; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  **Summary:** As case trends stabilized in spring 2020, California initiated a cautious reopening for “lower-risk” businesses. This order allowed curbside pickup and limited in–store operations for select retail establishments while higher–risk sectors remained closed. For Camarillo, this represented the first step toward reopening; however, the subsequent summer surge meant that many of these gains were short-lived, and businesses often had to adjust operations again later in Q3.

• **State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Rollback of Reopening**  
  – **Order Date:** July 13, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the new Blueprint tier framework  
  **Summary:** In response to rising COVID-19 cases in July 2020, the state reimposed closures on many sectors that had been reopened. Indoor dining, gyms, theaters and other high–contact businesses were forced to shut their doors again or operate with severe limitations. This mid–summer rollback had major economic repercussions and was a primary reason that Q3 2020 was challenging for businesses across California, including those in Camarillo.

• **"Blueprint for a Safer Economy" – Color-Tier Reopening System**  
  – **Order Date:** Announced August 28, 2020 (effective August 31, 2020)  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Transitioned out with the June 15, 2021 orders  
  **Summary:** The Blueprint replaced the earlier statewide mandates with a risk–based, color–coded system that assigned counties to tiers from Purple (most restrictive) to Yellow (least restrictive). Ventura County, which covers Camarillo, was initially placed in the Purple tier due to high local case rates. Businesses in Camarillo therefore had to continue operating under strict limitations (indoor operations were either heavily curtailed or prohibited), with only outdoor or limited-capacity options available during Q3 2020.

• **"Beyond the Blueprint" Reopening Order**  
  – **Order Number:** Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order  
  – **Date Enacted:** June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  **Summary:** This order formally ended the previous restrictions by rescinding the Stay-at-Home Order and retiring the Blueprint system, thus allowing full indoor operations to resume. Although significant for understanding the overall timeline, its issuance in mid–2021 also indicates how long restrictive measures persisted; in Q3 2020, businesses continued to suffer under the more rigid orders that this final reopening eventually replaced.

## Ventura County Orders

• **Ventura County Local Health Emergency Declaration**  
  – **Order Date:** March 12, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Remained in effect throughout 2020–2021 (ended in 2022)  
  **Summary:** Ventura County declared a local health emergency in early March 2020, which allowed local health officials to coordinate resources and enforce measures in line with state directives. While it did not by itself mandate business closures, this declaration legitimized and supported the subsequent health orders. For businesses in Camarillo (located in Ventura County), the ongoing emergency meant that more restrictive orders could be imposed swiftly, thus affecting operations well into Q3 2020.

• **Ventura County 'Stay Well at Home' Order**  
  – **Order Date:** March 20, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Effectively ended on June 11, 2021 as local restrictions were lifted  
  **Summary:** This order required all county residents to remain at home except for essential needs, which forced non–essential businesses to suspend in–person services. It provided the basic structure for all subsequent reopening orders—under which any easing was still tethered to its framework. During Q3 2020, even though certain sectors began to reopen, many businesses continued to operate under modified restrictions that evolved from this original order.

• **Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)**  
  – **Key Dates:** Extensions on March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020  
  **Summary:** With the situation evolving rapidly in spring 2020, the county repeatedly amended its stay–home order to extend restrictions and reinforce social distancing protocols. Even after partial reopening in May, these early updates laid the groundwork for the stringent operational guidelines that carried over into Q3 2020, affecting how businesses managed customer interactions and physical space.

• **"Safely Reopening Ventura County" Order (Stage 2 Reopening)**  
  – **Order Dates:** Initially May 7, 2020 (with an amendment on May 20, 2020)  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by the state Blueprint (August 31, 2020) and later the full reopening in June 2021  
  **Summary:** This order marked Ventura County’s tentative steps toward reopening by permitting designated lower–risk businesses to resume operations under strict protocols. It allowed outdoor or limited indoor operations for sectors such as retail (with curbside services) and, eventually, dine–in restaurants at reduced capacity. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses were still plying limited services based on these guidelines even as the situation remained volatile.

• **Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback**  
  – **Order Date:** July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Portions were lifted October 6, 2020 when the county moved into a less restrictive tier  
  **Summary:** As COVID-19 cases surged again in July 2020, the county enforced a rollback of certain reopenings by mandating the closure of indoor operations in sectors such as gyms, personal care services, and places of worship. This order had a direct economic hit on local businesses, forcing many that had reopened in May/June to close or limit operations once again during the challenging Q3 period.

• **Ventura County Eviction Moratorium**  
  – **Initial Order Date:** March 31, 2020 (with extensions into May and later through September 2020 for commercial tenants)  
  **Summary:** In order to alleviate the financial distress faced by business tenants (as well as residential tenants), Ventura County implemented a moratorium on evictions. This provided a crucial safety net, allowing businesses in Camarillo to avoid sudden loss of leased premises even as income dropped dramatically due to shutdowns and reduced capacity mandates. Although these protections were temporary and did not cancel owed rent, they were vital in helping small businesses weather the economic downturn of Q3 2020.

## City of Camarillo Orders

• **City of Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation**  
  – **Order Number:** EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36)  
  – **Date Enacted:** March 13, 2020  
  – **Date Rescinded:** Remained active into 2021 (formally ended in 2022)  
  **Summary:** Camarillo declared a local emergency which activated its Emergency Operations Center, allowing the city to coordinate immediate public health and safety measures. This included closing city facilities and cancelling public events—all of which affected local business activity either directly (through loss of customer footfall) or indirectly (by influencing community behavior). In Q3 2020, this declaration meant that the city could continue to implement measures (such as outdoor dining permits) to support businesses under constrained conditions.

• **Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders**  
  – **Order Numbers:** EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (initially issued March 18, 2020, and amended on April 23, 2020)  
  **Summary:** In a bid to prevent an additional economic crisis, Camarillo imposed a temporary moratorium on evictions for both residential and commercial tenants facing COVID-19–related financial hardship. This measure helped shield local businesses in Camarillo from the immediate risk of losing their leased space during Q3 2020, even though it did not waive rent obligations entirely.

• **Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program**  
  – **Date Enacted:** June 10, 2020 (with the order linked to the duration of the local state of emergency)  
  **Summary:** Recognizing the challenges faced by restaurants unable to serve indoor patrons, the Camarillo City Council passed this resolution to waive certain zoning restrictions and fees for temporary outdoor dining. The strategy enabled restaurants to expand their service areas outdoors, thus partially offsetting the losses caused by indoor dining closures. This measure was a key lifeline for many Camarillo eateries during Q3 2020, allowing them to generate revenue despite ongoing restrictions.

• **Miscellaneous City Measures**  
  **Summary:** Additional supportive actions included suspending late fees on business taxes, moving permit processes online, and promoting takeout campaigns. Such initiatives were designed to ease the operational burdens of businesses while the layered state and county restrictions continued to dictate in–person service limitations in Q3 2020.

## Overall Analysis

The tapestry of orders—from federal proclamations to state mandates, county stay–home orders, and city-specific measures—created a highly complex operating environment for business owners in Camarillo during 2020–2021. In Q3 2020, although there were attempts at partial reopening under modified guidelines, the re-imposition of restrictions (particularly the July state mandated rollback) and lingering capacity restrictions meant that many businesses continued to suffer financially and operationally. The combined effect of suspension orders (stay-at-home directives), capacity limitations via the Blueprint system, and economic relief measures such as eviction moratoria reflected the delicate balance policymakers tried to achieve between public health priorities and economic survival.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
This comprehensive review illustrates that while initial emergency declarations and strict stay–at-home mandates were gradually modified to allow some business activity, the resurgence of cases in mid–2020 led to renewed restrictions. As a result, Q3 2020 was a period defined by uncertainty, with businesses often operating at a fraction of their normal capacity and under evolving safety protocols. The various orders across different levels of government both constrained operations and provided economic protections (such as eviction moratoria), which together shaped the unique challenges facing Camarillo businesses during that quarter.
